      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a 27 year old Atlanta native who loves music and the Atlanta Falcons (although they hurt me so).</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Decatur and have lived in Atlanta for my whole life.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love collecting records, creating cocktails and playing with my dog, Bruce!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>It's always hard to pin down what a dream job is, but I'd probably be happiest working with music in some way.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently living in the West End of Atlanta.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It has always seemed like an interesting career path and skill to learn because it can be applied to almost any industry. I find it to be really cool that you can use these abilities to work on whatever interests you have and love, and aren't necessarily tied down.  </p>
